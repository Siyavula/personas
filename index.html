              <p>Keith is the head of the science department at an <strong>exclusive single-sex, private school</strong> and has been doing so for many years. He uses technology in the classroom, <strong>to pull up examples or material on the board</strong> (much like an overhead projector). Keith's students all have laptops and/or tablets but <strong>he doesn't believe that teaching Science on a computer is a good idea</strong>. In general, he is not convinced by the edtech movement.</p>

              <p>He feels that <strong>he is paid to stand in front of his class and teach them</strong>, and that parents at the school would not be impressed if he tried to 'replace himself' with computers in class. He <strong>doesn't want to place trust in a system that assigns work itself</strong> - he feels that "he knows what he wants the kids to know". <strong>He thinks kids are lazy</strong>, and that if they do work while connected to the internet, they'll just search for answers online or get completely distracted.</p>

              <p>While Keith acknowledges that his school is an ideal candidate for a product like Intelligent Practice (because all the kid have devices), <strong>he feels it's not compatible with his teaching methods</strong> and that it's superfluous for such a well-resourced school.</p>

            <div class="persona-details-more">
              <p>Suzanna teaches maths at a <strong>large former Model C (government) school</strong>. Her classroom is on the 3rd floor of the building, and she shares it with other teachers because <strong>the school is oversubscribed</strong>. If she wants to mark homework or tests, she has to do it in the staff room on the ground floor. <strong>The internet connection at her school is dismal</strong>. She can only get online in the computer lab, and even then it's really slow. <strong>The computers run Windows XP with Internet Explorer 7</strong>. Her kids have access to this lab but she has to book time in advance.</p>

              <p>Suzanna teaches <strong>very large classes</strong>. She's had <strong>huge issues getting her kids subscribed to IP</strong> using vouchers and collecting money from their parents. Every week she <strong>battles with resetting their usernames and passwords</strong>. Sometimes she only discovers that a child has lost their login details while the kids are practising and some of them aren't making any progress on her dashboard during class. <strong>She finds it very difficult to justify spending lots of time on or IP</strong> or integrate it successfully into her classroom because not all of her kids are signed up.</p>

              <p>Suzanna <strong>likes the practice service and loves the idea of using technology in the classroom</strong> but, by her own admission, is an impatient person. She very quickly tired of having to practice questions herself in order to view them, and <strong>gets very frustrated with how long it takes the website</strong> (books, practice, dashboard) to load. She does however, find it really useful to be able to pull up Everything Maths on her projector to <strong>show kids questions and examples in class</strong>.</p>

              <p>Bongani <strong>tutors part-time at a maths centre</strong> on the edge of a large township. Next door to the centre are a welding workshop and a sewing shop. The centre has two computer labs - one is dedicated to tutoring maths for kids in the senior grades. The other lab is shared between adult computer literacy classes and <strong>sessions for the kids in junior high school grades</strong>. The centre has <strong>decent computers</strong> (15 - 20 per lab) and internet connectivity but the <strong>cost of data can be prohibitive</strong>.</p>

              <p>The centre works on a first-come-first-serve basis (for kids from any schools) and if a kid's attendance drops below 75%, their place in the program is given to someone else.</p>

              <p>Bongani find that <strong>learners benefit from more prescriptive and structured ways of learning</strong>, otherwise they land up practising the wrong content.  He needs <strong>live diagnostics on a learner-by-learner basis</strong>, not just for a class, so that he can <strong>catch problems as and when they arise during a tutorial session</strong>.</p>

              <p>Literacy and computer literacy levels amongst the kids are low, so while the focus is on maths tutoring, Bongani also lands up <strong>helping kids improve their literacy, numeracy and computer skills during tutorials</strong>.</p>

              <p>Roger teaches science at a <strong>massively-resourced private school</strong>. Roger is <strong>hugely enthusiastic about technology and has successfully integrated it</strong> into his classroom and his teaching. All of his kids have access to laptops or tablets. Roger believes in <strong>encouraging his kids to take responsibility for their own learning</strong> - inside and outside of the classroom. Roger is a highly-skilled and very busy teacher, who is very enthusiastic about his subject and his career.</p>

              <p>Roger is a <strong>huge fan of Intelligent Practice</strong> and largely trusts the system, despite having encountered a few bugs. His kids have been frustrated by the learner experience on IP, but he still <strong>believes it adds value, and incorporates it as a small part of their class assessment</strong>. He uses the learner dashboard in class to show kids what they need to practice. He also pulls up the teacher dashboard to show his class how they're progressing. <strong>He finds the number of exercises and mastery vs speed plots, and the exercises summary on the teacher dash particularly useful</strong>. He would like his kids to have access to this information too. He uses these plots to get, at a glance, a sense of how much effort his kids have put in on the system, and how well they're working.</p>
